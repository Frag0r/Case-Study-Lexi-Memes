# Case-Study-Lexi-Memes
This case study will evaluate the methodology of the online resources www.knowyourmeme.com, an online encyclopedia for memes. 
Memes are regarded as part of internet culture, where they are created and distributed on a global scale for recreational purposes. 

The word meme was first introduced by Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene [1] in 1976:

“We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. 'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to 'memory', or to the French word même.”

To evaluate the methodology, it was necessary to extract as much information as possible from the website. I decided to write a python application because of my prior experience with text processing in this programming-language.
