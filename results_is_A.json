	"Ruqqus":   Ruqqus  is a U.S.-based, open-source aggregation platform for online communities that emphasizes no censorship and no moderator abuse. Similar to   Reddit,  content is ranked on an upvote/downvote scoring system determined by user votes. Users are free to share or say anything thatxefxbfxbds protected by the First Amendment, even if theyxefxbfxbdre not based in the U.S. Specific communities based around one topic are referred to as guilds. The site launched in late 2019, but grew in popularity mid-2020 after   Redditxefxbfxbds crackdown on certain communities  resulted in an exodus. In late 2019, Ruqqus  launched its website (seen below) after the creator expressed that Reddit was beginning to heavily censor content on the platform. From its origin, Ruqqus was intended to mimic Redditxefxbfxbds basic structure but focused on being censorship-free and moderator-abuse free. Anything posted to Ruqqus that falls under the protection of the First Amendment is allowed for all users both in or outside of the U.S. To allow for transparency, the platformxefxbfxbds codebase is openly available on   GitHub  ,  as well as the algorithms used to sort trending content. Similar to Reddit, Ruqqus  is an aggregation platform that allows users to post either original content or content found across the web. This content can then be upvoted or downvoted via a ranking system controlled by users, as well as commented on without censorship. Moderators similarly exist on the site but operate under more limited capacity. Mods on Ruqqus cannot delete content off the platform, but they can xefxbfxbdkickxefxbfxbd posts from their guilds (communities), which sends them into the catch-all xefxbfxbdgeneralxefxbfxbd category. Any content that violates site-wide policy is removed by admins on the core team. Moderators are only allowed to moderate a maximum of 10 guilds at any given time. Currently, Ruqqus also doesnxefxbfxbdt serve advertisements on the platform in an effort to avoid censorship surrounding them. Funding for the site comes from donations by users or out-of-pocket by the core team.   NSFW  content, including   pornography  , is also allowed on the site. Users can create an account on Ruqqus without an email while remaining anonymous. These users can then vote, comment, post or join guilds to customize their home feed to see content theyxefxbfxbdre interested in. Ruqqus is currently based primarily on a web browser (that also works on mobile) but has a beta version of an app in development. In July 2019, Ruqqus launched its   Twitter  account, which currently has about 700 followers. The admin team runs the account and posts updates, news and various discussions surrounding the platform. On June 17th, 2020, Redditor  TerrryTerrr posted a   Virgin vs. Chad  meme to the /r/virginvschad subreddit, depicting Reddit as the virgin and Ruqqus as the Chad (seen below).

	"Aragorn": "b"  Aragorn's xefxbfxbdFor Frodo,xefxbfxbd  also known as   Aragorn Black Gate,  is a memorable quote uttered by Aragorn (played by Viggo Mortensen) from the 2003 fantasy film  The quote is used alongside a still from the scene in a multitude of formats, including   object labeling   memes  ,   exploitable  photoshops,   image macros  and as a   catchphrase  without the image. The original clip the meme is pulled from is seen during the third and final   Lord of the Rings  movie,   The Return of the King,  specifically near the ending when the final battle for Middle Earth is underway and the remnants of humanity march towards Mordor to distract Sauron, thus providing Frodo and Sam a chance to sneak into Mount Doom so they can destroy the One Ring. During the scene (featured below), members of the Fellowship are gathered around the Black Gate alongside the remaining warriors of Gondor and Rohan in what is essentially a suicide mission to provoke Sauron and his orc army into leaving the lands of Mordor. The gate then opens and the army begins to surround the forces of good as they exchange worried looks of despair. Aragorn delivers his epic speech, emboldening the warriors, and dismounts his horse before turning to his companions and drawing his sword Andxefxbfxbdril. He then turns away from Sauronxefxbfxbds gaze and says, xefxbfxbdFor Frodo,xefxbfxbd as he leads the charge and rushes into the opposing forces. Though various images of the scene appear online several times before it was used as a meme, some of the earliest examples come from 2013.

	"New York Times Tom Cotton Op-ed Controversy":   New York TImes Tom Cotton Op-ed Controversy  refers to the backlash against the New York Times for publishing an op-ed piece by Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton advocating for the use of the U.S. military to quell the   2020 George Floyd Protests  . While James Bennet, the Opinions page editor, stood by publishing the piece on the grounds it wanted to portray a variety of opinions on the subject, critics, including workers at the New York Times, have argued that publishing the piece endangered black lives and was a complicit endorsement of   fascism  and military occupation. On June 3rd, 2020, as the   George Floyd  Protests continued and incidents of police violence and looting spread, the New York Times published an op-ed written by Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton titled, "Send In the Troops."  The piece advocates for military intervention in the protests, with Cotton writing, "One thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakersxefxbfxbd itxefxbfxbds past time to support local law enforcement with federal authority." The piece and the New York Times decision to publish it was quickly met with outrage from readers on   Twitter  . Minutes after it was posted, Twitter user @karenyhan  posted a screenshot of the article's title, writing "hey @nytimes what the fuck is this?", gaining over 6,900 retweets and 39,000 likes (shown below, left). User @aquariaofficial  wrote, "This is alarming + incites terror and normalizes martial law within states. NYT is irresponsible for publishing this article and therexefxbfxbds no way in HELL Ixefxbfxbdll be following the opinion of a xefxbfxbdMr. Tom Cotton,xefxbfxbd a Republican senator from Arkansas. We do not need troops. We need justice," gaining over 530 retweets and 2,400 likes (shown below, right). Others argued that publishing the piece would endanger the Times' very own employees, particularly as several instances of police attacking journalists covering the protests were caught on camera. Several Times employees tweeted "Running this puts Black @nytimes staff in danger."  Times employees also sent a letter to editors and executives at the paper,  writing:  xefxbfxbdWe believe his message undermines the work we do, in the newsroom and in opinion, and violates our standards for ethical and accurate reporting for the publicxefxbfxbds interest. It also jeopardizes our journalistsxefxbfxbd ability to work safely and effectively on the streetsxefxbfxbd. In publishing an Op-Ed that appears to call for violence, promotes hate, and rests its arguments on several factual inaccuracies while glossing over other matters that require--and were not met with--expert legal interpretation, we     fail    our readersxefxbfxbd. Heeding a call to xefxbfxbdsend in the troopsxefxbfxbd has historically resulted in harm to black and brown people, like the ones who are vital members of The New York Times family.xefxbfxbd  Many called on James Bennet, the New York Times Opinion Editor, to resign.  Several others called for boycotts and unsubscriptions from the New York Times.   Donald Trump Jr.  tweeted a link to an op-ed written by the deputy leader of the Taliban that the New York Times published in February of 2020.  Bennet defended the publication of the Cotton piece in a Twitter thread,  saying "Times Opinion owes it to our readers to show them counter-arguments, particularly those made by people in a position to set policy. We understand that many readers find Senator Cotton's argument painful, even dangerous. We believe that is one reason it requires public scrutiny and debate." The piece also led to a renewed surge of   New York Times Opinions Parodies  . For example, @pixelatedboat  tweeted a parody that gained over 16,000 retweets and 85,000 likes (shown below, left). @drmistercody  tweeted an   I Am Become Death  parody, gaining over 410 retweets and 4,000 likes (shown below, right). Over the following day, the Times faced and published backlash from their staff about the piece. Michelle Goldberg published a piece titled "Tom Cotton's Fascist Op-Ed" on June 4th.  The Times itself wrote that the piece did not meet its editorial standards.  They admitted that James Bennet had not read the piece prior to its publication, and would look into short and long-term solutions for its editorial process. The New York Times held a town-hall meeting with staff on June 5th, where it was rumored that the Op-Ed team had pitched the piece to Tom Cotton, rather than the other way around.  Meanwhile, Cotton appeared to revel in the unrest his piece caused in the Times, tweeting since-deleted taunts at people angry at his piece.  On June 7th, Bennet resigned as editor of the New York Times Opinion page.  He is succeeded by Katie Kingsbury.'",
	"Laughing Wolves":   Laughing Wolves,  also known as   Three Wolves,  is an   exploitable   image macro  series depicting three white wolves with two of them laughing at each other and the other staring unamused into the distance. The format is typically used as an   object labeling  meme where each wolf is labeled as someone or something, but also as a simple   reaction image.  The meme shares many similarities to the   Ryan Reynolds Between Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal  format.

	"A Letter on Justice and Open Debate":   A Letter on Justice and Open Debate  , often referred to as   The Letter  or   The Harper's Open Letter  , is an open letter published by Harper's Magazine and signed by over 150 writers, academics and artists which called to stand against an "intolerant climate" regarding ideological diversity. Online, the letter spawned numerous online debates over free speech and   cancel culture  . Various prominent figures signed the letter, including writer Margaret Atwood, choreographer Bill T. Jones, linguist   Noam Chomsky  ,   Vox  co-founder Matt Yglesias, psychologist Steven Pinker, writer   J.K. Rowling  , musician Wynton Marsalis and writer Salman Rushdie. On July 7th, 2020, Harper's  published the letter, which stated that "censoriousness"  that had been previously expected from "the radical right" had become more commonplace.   Our cultural institutions are facing a moment of trial. Powerful protests for racial and social justice are leading to overdue demands for police reform, along with wider calls for greater equality and inclusion across our society, not least in higher education, journalism, philanthropy, and the arts. But this needed reckoning has also intensified a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity. As we applaud the first development, we also raise our voices against the second. The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength throughout the world and have a powerful ally in     Donald Trump    , who represents a real threat to democracy. But resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion--which right-wing demagogues are already exploiting. The democratic inclusion we want can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.   The free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted. While we have come to expect this on the radical right, censoriousness is also spreading more widely in our culture: an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty. We uphold the value of robust and even caustic counter-speech from all quarters. But it is now all too common to hear calls for swift and severe retribution in response to perceived transgressions of speech and thought. More troubling still, institutional leaders, in a spirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms. Editors are fired for running controversial pieces; books are withdrawn for alleged inauthenticity; journalists are barred from writing on certain topics; professors are investigated for quoting works of literature in class; a researcher is fired for circulating a peer-reviewed academic study; and the heads of organizations are ousted for what are sometimes just clumsy mistakes. Whatever the arguments around each particular incident, the result has been to steadily narrow the boundaries of what can be said without the threat of reprisal. We are already paying the price in greater risk aversion among writers, artists, and journalists who fear for their livelihoods if they depart from the consensus, or even lack sufficient zeal in agreement.   This stifling atmosphere will ultimately harm the most vital causes of our time. The restriction of debate, whether by a repressive government or an intolerant society, invariably hurts those who lack power and makes everyone less capable of democratic participation. The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away. We refuse any false choice between justice and freedom, which cannot exist without each other. As writers we need a culture that leaves us room for experimentation, risk taking, and even mistakes. We need to preserve the possibility of good-faith disagreement without dire professional consequences. If we wonxefxbfxbdt defend the very thing on which our work depends, we shouldnxefxbfxbdt expect the public or the state to defend it for us.  That day,   Redditor  mugen40k submitted the letter to /r/chomsky,  where it gathered more than 480 comments and 285 points (98% upvoted) in 24 hours. Meanwhile, historian Kerri Greenidge   tweeted  that she did not "endorse" the letter and that she was "in contact with Harper's about a retraction." Her name was subsequently removed from the list of signatories. That evening, author Jennifer Boylan tweeted an apology, stating that she "did not know who else signed that letter." In response, writer Malcolm Gladwell tweeted  that he signed the letter because there were other signatories who held views he disagreed with, stating "I thought that was the point of the Harpers letter" (shown below). Also on July 7th, Vox writer Emily VanDerWerff tweeted  a letter sent to Vox editors, stating that while she did not wish for Yglesias to be reprimanded for signing the letter, she felt "deeply saddened" to see his name on the list of signatures and that she also felt "less safe at Vox" (shown below). Within 24 hours, the tweet received upwards of 13,000 likes and 2,000 retweets. Meanwhile,   Anthony Fantano  tweeted  xefxbfxbd'Cancel Culture' would be a lot less controversial if it was called 'People Reacting To Me Being A Shithead Culture'" (shown below, left).

Also on July 8th, Vox co-founder Ezra Klein tweeted  that "debates that sell themselves as being about free speech are actually about power" and that the "mantle of free speech defender" is very powerful.

The Trump campaign has defended using the symbol, stating that the American anti-fascist movement known as   Antifa  had reclaimed the symbol. Critics of Trump contend that their use of the symbol is an overt   dog  whistle to white supremacists. On June 17th, 2020, Fortune magazine editor John Buysse   tweeted  ,  "This Trump Facebook ad attacking Antifa uses an upside down red triangle that sure looks like axefxbfxbd *checks notes* Nazi concentration camp badge for "political prisoners, social democrats, socialists, communists and anarchists, rescuers of Jews, trade unionists, and Freemasons."

The following day,   Facebook  announced that the ads were removed for violating   Facebook  's policy against organized hate. They said: On June 18th, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign Tim Murtaugh said, "The red triangle is an antifa symbol." The Washington Post  writes that Murtaugh pointed to examples of "iPhone cases and water bottles branded with the insignia." The verified Trump campaign Twitter account @TrumpWarRoom refuted posts online. They wrote, "This is an emoji. ?? It's also a symbol widely used by Antifa. It was used in an ad about Antifa. It is not in the ADL's Hate Symbols Database" (shown below, left). Reporter Jordan Uhl responded,  "Google image search showsxefxbfxbd..zero other uses of this pic outside of this tweet.

However, an upload date for the image could not be verified. Searches for the red triangle as an antifa symbol, as reported by some, have been largely inconclusive. Though, there is one example available from the Dutch anti-fascist group Antifa Utrecht.  On August 27th, 2016, the group uploaded their logo which features a red triangle (shown below).

On October 5th, 2019, the film   Parasite  was released in the United States. In the film, director Bong Joon Ho creates a metaphor for income inequality and economic classes through a wealthy family's home. One of the film's major plot points involves a man living in the family's basement unbeknownst to them.

Guess The Gibberish was created by   Microsoft  intern Christopher Lu and launched April 14th, 2020.  Over the following week, the filter gained over 1 billion impressions.
