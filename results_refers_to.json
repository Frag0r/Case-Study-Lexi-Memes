	"Fnatic Manager Here, Please Delete This":   Fnatic Manager Here, Please Delete This  refers to a   catchphrase  popular in  community and the eSports community as a whole that is often used to jokingly comment on unusual in-game strategies or exploits being discovered and showcased. The catchprase stems from the iconic 2014   CS:GO  match during which Fnatic executed a previously unknown unique boost on the map Overpass which helped them win the game, after which a rumor that Fnatic asked the player who discovered the boost to take down his video was circulated. On November 28th, 2014, during a quarterfinal match of DreamHack Winter 2014,   Counter-Strike: Global Offensive  team Fnatic employed a previously unknown tactic against Team LDLC.com on the map Overpass.  The team used a previously unknown boost to perch their player Olofmeister to a very advantageous position, from which he scored several game-winning kills.  The boost ultimately allowed Fnatic to win the map and the series. Following the match Team LDLC.com filed a complaint against "pixel-walking," against Fnatic. While the complaint did not match any official rules of the tournament, DreamHack decided that the match will be replayed after revealing that the boost could be exploited in other ways. Fnatic ultimately decided to forfeit the replay, with LDLC proceeding to win the tournament.  On November 10th, 2014, two weeks before the tournament,   Redditor  Blotecsgo (Davit Ekdhal) posted a video of the boost (shown below, left), discovered by his friend Kallberg. Following the match, on November 28th, 2014, Blotecsgo posted a thread in /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit  in which he claimed that after the video was uploaded, Fnatic player JW reached out to him via his friend with a request to remove it (comment shown below, right). The video was made private until November 28th, 2014. Blotecsgo provided no hard proof for his claim that Fnatic asked him to remove the video. Starting on November 28th, the claim that Fnatic asked Blotecsgo to remove his video received viral spread in /r/GlobalOffensive, with multiple Redditors  bringing it up in discussions related to the Fnatic vs. Team LDLC.com match (examples shown below). On November 29th, 2014, Redditor  supacid posted the earliest known comment which exploited the idea of Fnatic reaching out to someone who discovered an advantageous tactic or an exploit (shown below, left). Starting on that day, the joke started spreading in /r/GlobalOffensive subreddit, being used to comment on videos showcasing boosts, exploits, throw angles and strategies. For example, on November 30th, Redditors Syndicateofdoom  and Dahdii  posted such comments in a thread showcasing a glitched Molotov throw (Syndicateofdoom's comment shown below, right). On December 5th, Redditor  Smygande made the joke in a comment to in a thread about a smoke throw angle on the Mirage map. In the following years, the joke, refined to "Fnatic manager here, please delete this," has seen consistent use by the   Counter-Strike  community on Reddit and   Twitter  , later gaining larger recognition in the general eSports community.'",

	"New York Times Tom Cotton Op-ed Controversy":   New York TImes Tom Cotton Op-ed Controversy  refers to the backlash against the New York Times for publishing an op-ed piece by Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton advocating for the use of the U.S. military to quell the   2020 George Floyd Protests  . While James Bennet, the Opinions page editor, stood by publishing the piece on the grounds it wanted to portray a variety of opinions on the subject, critics, including workers at the New York Times, have argued that publishing the piece endangered black lives and was a complicit endorsement of   fascism  and military occupation. On June 3rd, 2020, as the   George Floyd  Protests continued and incidents of police violence and looting spread, the New York Times published an op-ed written by Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton titled, "Send In the Troops."  The piece advocates for military intervention in the protests, with Cotton writing, "One thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakersxefxbfxbd itxefxbfxbds past time to support local law enforcement with federal authority." The piece and the New York Times decision to publish it was quickly met with outrage from readers on   Twitter  . Minutes after it was posted, Twitter user @karenyhan  posted a screenshot of the article's title, writing "hey @nytimes what the fuck is this?", gaining over 6,900 retweets and 39,000 likes (shown below, left). User @aquariaofficial  wrote, "This is alarming + incites terror and normalizes martial law within states. NYT is irresponsible for publishing this article and therexefxbfxbds no way in HELL Ixefxbfxbdll be following the opinion of a xefxbfxbdMr. Tom Cotton,xefxbfxbd a Republican senator from Arkansas. We do not need troops. We need justice," gaining over 530 retweets and 2,400 likes (shown below, right). Others argued that publishing the piece would endanger the Times' very own employees, particularly as several instances of police attacking journalists covering the protests were caught on camera. Several Times employees tweeted "Running this puts Black @nytimes staff in danger."  Times employees also sent a letter to editors and executives at the paper,  writing:  xefxbfxbdWe believe his message undermines the work we do, in the newsroom and in opinion, and violates our standards for ethical and accurate reporting for the publicxefxbfxbds interest. It also jeopardizes our journalistsxefxbfxbd ability to work safely and effectively on the streetsxefxbfxbd. In publishing an Op-Ed that appears to call for violence, promotes hate, and rests its arguments on several factual inaccuracies while glossing over other matters that require--and were not met with--expert legal interpretation, we     fail    our readersxefxbfxbd. Heeding a call to xefxbfxbdsend in the troopsxefxbfxbd has historically resulted in harm to black and brown people, like the ones who are vital members of The New York Times family.xefxbfxbd  Many called on James Bennet, the New York Times Opinion Editor, to resign.  Several others called for boycotts and unsubscriptions from the New York Times.   Donald Trump Jr.  tweeted a link to an op-ed written by the deputy leader of the Taliban that the New York Times published in February of 2020.  Bennet defended the publication of the Cotton piece in a Twitter thread,  saying "Times Opinion owes it to our readers to show them counter-arguments, particularly those made by people in a position to set policy. We understand that many readers find Senator Cotton's argument painful, even dangerous. We believe that is one reason it requires public scrutiny and debate." The piece also led to a renewed surge of   New York Times Opinions Parodies  . For example, @pixelatedboat  tweeted a parody that gained over 16,000 retweets and 85,000 likes (shown below, left). @drmistercody  tweeted an   I Am Become Death  parody, gaining over 410 retweets and 4,000 likes (shown below, right). Over the following day, the Times faced and published backlash from their staff about the piece. Michelle Goldberg published a piece titled "Tom Cotton's Fascist Op-Ed" on June 4th.  The Times itself wrote that the piece did not meet its editorial standards.  They admitted that James Bennet had not read the piece prior to its publication, and would look into short and long-term solutions for its editorial process. The New York Times held a town-hall meeting with staff on June 5th, where it was rumored that the Op-Ed team had pitched the piece to Tom Cotton, rather than the other way around.  Meanwhile, Cotton appeared to revel in the unrest his piece caused in the Times, tweeting since-deleted taunts at people angry at his piece.  On June 7th, Bennet resigned as editor of the New York Times Opinion page.  He is succeeded by Katie Kingsbury.'",

The Trump campaign has defended using the symbol, stating that the American anti-fascist movement known as   Antifa  had reclaimed the symbol.
